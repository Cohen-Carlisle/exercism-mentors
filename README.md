# Exercism Mentors

We are always looking for more mentors to help new people ramp up in the programming languages that Exercism supports.

## How many mentors do we need?

Well, that depends. For any given track, the minimum number of active mentors is *five*. This ensures that the burden is never too great for a single mentor, even when life gets busy for a bit, or you go on vacation. Beyond this, we need an extra mentor for every ten-twelve additional submissions per week.

For reference, the most active track at the moment is the Python track, with about 150 submissions per day. This equates roughly to a need for about 90 active mentors.
