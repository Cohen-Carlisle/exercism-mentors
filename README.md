# Exercism Mentors

We are always looking for more mentors to help new people ramp up in the programming languages that Exercism supports.

## Crowd-sourced mentor notes
The structure within the repository is: `/tracks/ruby/exercises/isogram/README.md`.

- You can easily edit the files within GitHub to create Pull Requests for changes.
- We'll be offering some mentors write permissions to the repo so that they can merge PRs without waiting for us to check everything.
- In the near-future we'll auto-pull things into the website to display it for mentors at the relevant time.

Please use `###` for headings and try to keep to a structure of:

- **Reasonable solutions:** 1+ solutions that solve this problem well.
- **Common suggestions:** Good suggestions specific to this exercise. Good lessons that emerge from it.
- **Talking points:** Questions to challenge more advance learners with.

Here's an example for [Ruby's Isogram](https://github.com/exercism/mentors/blob/master/tracks/ruby/exercises/isogram/README.md).

## General Mentoring Questions

### How many mentors do we need?

Well, that depends. For any given track, the minimum number of active mentors is *five*. This ensures that the burden is never too great for a single mentor, even when life gets busy for a bit, or you go on vacation. Beyond this, we need an extra mentor for every ten-twelve additional submissions per week.

For reference, the most active track at the moment is the Python track, with about 150 submissions per day. This equates roughly to a need for about 90 active mentors, each giving about 1 hour per week.
