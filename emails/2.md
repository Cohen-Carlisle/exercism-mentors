Hi,

It's been an exciting week in Exercism-land as we've now recruited 50% of the mentors we need to launch. Thank you if you've been inviting your friends and colleagues!

I have one update, one request, and one offer:

1) We will be launching a version of the new website just for mentors this week where you can practice mentoring in the new interface. This will give you an opportunity to try things out, get familiar with the tooling and exercises, and report any bugs! I will let you know when that is launched.

2) In preparation for that please can you ensure that you're registered on Slack and in the correct channels for your chosen languages. This will correspond to which tracks you mentor on the test (and eventually live) site. I explained this more here: https://exercism-mentors.slack.com/archives/CANG20CKE/p1528843725000303

3) As part of the new website we want to feature our mentors on the relevant track pages and the "Our Mentors" page. If you would like to appear on the website, please follow the instructions here: https://github.com/exercism/website-copy/blob/master/mentors/README.md#mentors

We're only 3 weeks away from launch now and both very excited and a bit nervous. Thanks for being on this journey with us!

Jeremy and the Exercism team
