Hi,

I have two pieces of exciting news. Firstly, we've hit the amazing milestone of having 500 mentors! We're incredibly humbled and excited that you've all joined up to help others improve their coding skills. Thank you! 

Secondly, we have two developers working full time on Exercism for the summer sponsored by RailsGirls Summer of Code. Amalia (amaliacardenas) and Lori (loriking) will be working on helping develop the mentoring-side of Exercism, working on resources and tooling to help make your time on Exercism as fun and easy as possible. Please say hello to them on Slack over the next few days :)

I have created at #start-here channel on Slack with a checklist of what you need to do before launch. Please check you've done everything there. You can find it here: https://exercism-mentors.slack.com/archives/CBDA9LMDF/p1529968977000336

Only 50% of people have joined the correct language channels. **Please double-check that you have** as we need to understand where to spend money advertising for mentors, and we don't want it to go to waste.

We're about two weeks from launch now and getting more excited by the day. Thanks for being part of this journey!

Jeremy and the Exercism team
