Hey,

The mentors testing site is now live for you to use!

This site is a version of the new Exercism, exclusive for mentors, where you can learn the exercises, explore the mentoring interface and practice your mentoring skills. It's also an opportunity to highlight any bugs or issues that are there.

- The website is here: https://mentors-beta.exercism.io/
- You can get a copy of the CLI that works against it here: http://bit.ly/2JZKqnT
- You need to configure the CLI client with your token, which you can get here: https://mentors-beta.exercism.io/my/settings and the command is `mentorcism configure --token=TOKEN`

**Please read these things carefully:**

- We need everyone to submit solutions as well as to mentor, else there will be nothing to mentor! Feel free to submit solutions in your mentor-languages or on different language that you want to learn.

- You will become a mentor of any track you join (this is because I've not had time to do the Slack integration yet).

- This is an empty db. Old solutions won't be there. You can of course submit an old solution through the CLI if you want to. Instructions are here: https://exercism-mentors.slack.com/archives/CAQP7JL3T/p1529612222000221?thread_ts=1529612208.000076&cid=CAQP7JL3T

- If you find anything that's broken, please report it at https://github.com/exercism/v2-feedback/issues

- While building better tools for mentors is high on our roadmap, we're actively not asking for feature requests at this time, unless they're something you consider critical. Once we've launched and got everything working well, then we'll start exploring next steps with you :)

- Feel free to bounce any questions on Slack in either the #questions channel (for more formal questions) or #chat if you want to discuss things.

We're really excited to see you all on there soon!

Thanks,
Jeremy and the Exercism team
