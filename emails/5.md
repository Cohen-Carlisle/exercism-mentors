Hi,

We're live!! There are still lots of rough edges and things we want to improve and add, but we're happy with where we've got to and have put it live. Thank you to everyone who has tried things out and given us feedback over the last few weeks - it's been invaluable. The fun starts here!

To get started, please follow these instructions in Slack: https://exercism-mentors.slack.com/archives/CBDA9LMDF/p1529968977000336

We've started writing a mentoring guide here (https://exercism.io/mentoring-guide) and put some FAQs together here (https://exercism.io/mentoring-faqs)

Please note that the mentors-beta site and mentorcism are now dead. Everything is live on the real site (https://exercism.io). If you've been submitting solutions to the site, you should be able to (easily) to submit them to the new site instead. The new CLI is here: https://github.com/exercism/cli/releases/tag/v3.0.1

We had ~1,000 solutions submitted per day to the old site and we expect this to grow over the next few days as things like email notifications bring people back more than before, so we're going to need a continuing flow of new mentors to help out. If you know anyone that you think would make a great mentor, please do encourage them to check out http://mentoring.exercism.io/

Thanks so much for being part of this journey. We're super excited and somewhat terrified right now :)
